<h2>ActiveFacts Example Models and introduction to ORM2</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Copyright (c) 2007 Clifford Heath.</font></p>

<p>This links to a number of example ORM2 model files in various representations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A number of ORM2 models in a <a href="norma/ExampleModels.sln">project</a>
    for Visual Studio 2005 (Pro) with <a href="http://sf.net/projects/orm">NORMA</a>
    installed,</li>
  <li><a href="pdf">PDF</a> documents showing the diagrams from the above
    project, and images for some of those,</li>
  <li>A Ruby code <a href="ruby">example</a> using a proposed Ruby DSL (Domain Specific
    Language) to define a model</li>
</ul>
<p>The models are as follows. ORM2 terminology is <i>italicised</i> on first
use.</p>

<h3>CompanyDirector</h3>
<p>This very simple <a href="pdf/CompanyDirector.pdf">model</a> shows a
basic example of the features of ORM2 you'll be seeing most often, so
I'll use it to introduce the features of the ORM2 visual language.
<p><center>
<img src="images/CompanyDirector.png"></p>
</center></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Entity Types</i>: <b>Person</b> and <b>Company</b>, and
    <i>Value Types</i>: Name and Date are value types. Collectively, they're
    called Concepts. Value types have a dashed outline.
  </li>

  <li>Entity <i>Identification schemes</i>: Person is identified by the pair
    (given-Name, family-Name), as indicated by the circle with two lines across it.
    Company is identified using the common <b>.Name</b> reference mode.
    CompanyName is a value type that is implicit in the reference mode, hidden
    because it's such a common pattern.
    </li>

  <li><i>Fact Types</i> define relationships between concepts. They're displayed
    as a series of one or more <i>Role</i> boxes. For example, the fact type
    "Person has given-Name" has two roles, played by Person and Name.
    </li>

  <li><i>Objectified Fact Type:</i> <b>Directorship</b> and <b>Meeting</b> are
    fact types that are also entities, and thus can play other roles, such as
    the role of Directorship in "Directorship began on appointment-Date".
    </li>

  <li><i>Fact Readings</i> are displayed as text under each fact type. A fact
    type may have many readings, though only the preferred one is shown on the
    diagram. Binary fact types may display a reading for each direction. An
    arrow is displayed if a single reading is to be read in the opposite order
    from the obvious one.
    </li>

  <li><i>Uniqueness constraints</i>: The horizontal lines above the fact types
    are uniqueness constraints (UC). There are seven UCs showing. A UC covering
    a single role allows that role's player to occur only once in the population
    of fact instances. A UC that covers two or more roles allows any combination
    of those players, but only once for each combination. Every fact type must
    have at least one UC that covers all, or all-but-one, of its roles.  Any
    fewer and the fact type is not <i>elementary</i>.  Elementarity is an important
    reason why semantic modeling is an effective technique.
    </li>

  <li><i>Mandatory constraint</i>: The heavy dot on the Company role box of
    Director is a mandatory constraint (MC) that requires every company to have
    at least one director (similarly for appointment-Date). A mandatory
    constraint may also be shown as a hollow dot, which says <i>should</i>,
    rather than <i>must</i> (the technical terms are <i>deontic</i> rather
    than <i>alethic</i>).</li>
</ul>


<br clear="all">
<h3>SchoolActivities
</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="images/SchoolActivities.png"></p>
<p>This model shows a ternary (which represents a student's participation in a
school-sanctioned activity). The Participation ternary has a UC spanning two
roles (which says that a given Student may only participate in a given Activity
for a single School). But there are two occurrences of a new symbol, <i>subset constraints<b>.</b></i>
These constraints specify restrictions on the allowed <i>fact population</i> of
the ternary fact type. The UC doesn't specify <b>which</b> school a student may
represent for an activity. The student is enrolled in exactly one school, and
the set of (School, Student) pairs is a superset of the (School, Student) pair
inside the ternary. In simple terms, this requires that each student who
participates in some activity may only do so as a representative of the school
in which they're enrolled, and not for any other school. Furthermore, the upper
subset constraint requires that such participation may only occur for an activity
that is sanctioned by that school. The direction of the subset arrow is consistent
with the arrows used in sub-typing, as shown in the next case.
</p>

<br clear="all">
<h3>EmployeeManagerCEO
</h3>
<img src="images/EmployeeManagerCEO.png" align="right">
<p>This example introduces many of the remaining features of ORM2, and shows one
way to handle a particular thorny problem. The most obvious new features are the
subtype relationships, which show respectively that a Person may be an Employee,
and may be a Manager, and if a Manager, also a CEO. There is no implicit exclusion
between the two; a manager may also be an employee. Any required constraints
of this type may be added, joining to the subtype connectors. Logically, there
is a binary <i>subtyping fact type</i> to which these constraints would attach.
</p>

<p>The manages/managed by fact type between employee and manager is mandatory
for each manager (a manager must have subordinates), but not for employee -
because the CEO is an employee who has no manager. </p>

<p>Here we see a <i>unary fact type</i> called <b>is CEO</b>, which corresponds
to a boolean condition on the player (a manager). An external <i>exclusive-or</i>
constraint joins this role and the employee's role in &quot;managed by&quot;.
This constraint requires that <i>each employee must either be CEO or be managed
by some manager, but not both</i>. Note that the exclusive-or symbol consists of
a heavy dot, like the mandatory dot, indicating the mandatory aspect, and an X,
symbolising &quot;not both&quot;. ORM2 also allows <i>external mandatory
constraints</i> (or <i>inclusive-or constraints</i>) shown like this but without
the X, and external exclusion constraints which have the X but not the heavy dot. </p>

<p>The final new feature of this model is a <i>ring constraint</i>, of which
there are eleven types. This one is an <i>acyclic constraint</i>, which says
that no manager may be self-managed, nor may they be managed by any direct or
indirect subordinate.
</p>

<br clear="all">
<h3>ObjectifiedUnary
</h3>
<img src="images/ObjectifiedUnary.png" align="right">
This example is more a curiosity than anything else, serving to illustrate a case
that you might not otherwise think was possible. Person may play a unary role in
the fact type &quot;is dead&quot;. If they are in fact dead, we might wish to
record some facts about the event of their death, so we nest (objectify) the
&quot;is dead&quot; fact type as a new entity, Death. This allows us to
associate their death with a value indicating the cause of death. The uniqueness
constraint requires that we record only one cause of death.
<p>

<br clear="all">
<h3>
Address
</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Address.png"></p>

<p>By now you're asking how all this mess of detail is going to be turned into a
usable database design. Before moving on to a larger real-life example, let's
cover the concept of <i>absorption</i> into a relational, or <i>compound</i>
schema. Note that the absorption process requires <b>all</b> the entity types,
fact types, and constraints for the model. Adding a single fact type or changing
a constraint might require that some features are represented in new tables, or
different ones, and these changes can <b>cascade</b>, so that a small change in
the conceptual model requires a large database migration. Don't worry about that
for now, as there are ways of minimizing the impact, and in the future the
migration process will be fully automatic, and larger impacts may perhaps even
be delayed without delaying the incremental schema change.
</p>

<p>
Before launching in, we see an external uniqueness constraint here for the first
time. it joins the roles of FamilyName and GivenName; this schema will never
allow two people to have the same two names. Normally, an external UC has a
single line through the middle of the circle, consistent with the single line
above covered roles in an internal UC, but this one is also a preferred
identifier (for Person, obviously), so it has a double line. A double line is
also used when showing a internal UC that's a PI.
</p>

<img src="images/AddressSQL.png" align="left">
<p>Ok, here goes. How is it that the SQL for this whole detailed diagram
requires only the table shown (and a similar one for Company)? You can see that
Street has exactly three StreetLine values allowed, and is identified by the
combination, so here we can <b>absorb</b> these fact roles into a Street entity,
which would be shown as an objectified type Street having three fact roles, one
for each street line.  The same principle applies again to Address, except here
it absorbs StreetNumber, City, Postcode and <b>all three</b> roles of the Street
nested type. The same process continues with Person, which is finally absorbed
to the single table you see shown in the SQL code. Note how the respective role
names are appended to form column names like <b>streetLine1</b>. </p>

<p>Note also that this table doesn't enforce the uniqueness constraint requiring
that each Address occurs once only. Each Address is identified by its roles, but
more than one person may live at the same address.
Enforcement of the uniqueness constraints are unnecessary however. Just consider
the absorbed Address roles as forming a multi-part <i>foreign key</i> to a table
that's not needed. If someone wants the unique list of all addresses, it's
possible to write an SQL projection to compute that set.</p>

<p>It's also possible to mark Address as an <i>independent entity type</i>,
which is an instruction to the absorption process that indicates that this
entity might exist apart from any roles it might play. Independent entity types
are shown in ORM2 as having an exclamation point <b>!</b> after their name. In
order to represent an independent entity type in SQL, a separate table is always
needed, and this can be used to enforce uniqueness. In this case however, Person
would have a large multi-part foreign key into the new Address table, so it's
preferable to introduce a <i>surrogate key</i> in the form of a
database-allocated unique integer into the address entity, and mark that key as
the preferred identifier instead. Note that this is <b>not</b> a detail of the
conceptual model, but is merely a pragmatic concern which should not need to be
shown; instead the absorption process should apply rules that require it to
introduce such a surrogate key. Unfortunately this feature is not yet present in
NORMA.</p>

<h3>
Orienteering
</h3>
<p>Finally, a working three-part model of a system for the sport of Orienteering.
The three parts cover administration, registration and scoring respectively,
which also happens to map areas of interest to folk in different roles.
Any feature may show on more than one diagram, and the ORM2 rules don't indicate
that such an element has a special affinity with any diagram on which it appears.
Entities that appear on other diagrams are shown with a drop-shadow. The diagrams
are presented without much comment, and after that, the absorbed (compound) form
is shown as an entity-relationship diagram.  </p>

<h3>
Administration
</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Orienteering/Administration.png"></p>
A couple of new features are shown here. <i>Value restrictions</i> or constraints
and <i>role value restrictions</i> are shown in mauve. These are lists of values,
or of ranges of values, which are drawn from the allowed values of the underlying
value type, and restrict that value type or that role to values in the defined set.</p>

<p>Also here you'll see an external mandatory constraint shown for the first
time. This one requires that an event is either part of a series, or has a name,
or both. If and only if the event is part of a series, it must also have a
number in that series - this is shown by the <i>equality constraint</i>, a
circle with an = sign in it.  </p>

<p>Finally there is a number of cases throughout this model where a surrogate
key is used. In a pure conceptual modelling tool these should be only be used
where they will be meaningful to the end-user of the system, but in practise
it can be difficult to find a natural identification scheme, so surrogate
identifiers are used more widely.
In addition to that, this resultant model is to be used with Ruby on Rails,
whose ActiveRecord module has a strong preference for surrogate keys on every
table.
<br clear="all">
</p>

<h3>
Registration
</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Orienteering/Registration.png"></p>
<p>
The new feature here is an external x-or constraint on two subtype connectors, indicating that
an Entrant must be either a Team or a Competitor, but not both.
The subset constraint requires that a competitor may only be entered as a
team member if their team is already entered for that same event course.
</p>

<br clear="all">
</p>
<h3>
Scoring
</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Orienteering/Scoring.png"></p>
<!--
Just for the sake of completeness, this diagram shows a <i>frequency
constraint</i>, attached to the placement of a punch at an event.
This constraint requires that no more than 4 punches be placed at
any control point for a given event. A frequency constraint can be
added on a non-mandatory role or role sequence, for example we could
require that at least 2 but no more than 4 punches are placed at
each control point, and that the recording of these placements is
not mandatory. If any punch is recorded, the number recorded must
fall in the required range.
-->

<p>This model also shows the resultant
score for a given Entrant's Entry to a given Event. Normally this
value will be computed from the times of their visits to punches
during the event, and according to a scoring method as advised.
However in this case we cannot record the complexities of all
possible scoring algorithms, nor the discretion of the judges in
possibly adjusting scores, and we don't require that Visit information
necessarily be recorded in any case.  Either there may be no
electronic recording of visits, or the score might depend only on
finishing order, and a provisional score awarded to be checked
against valid Visit data at a later time.

<br clear="all">
</p>

<h3>
Relational Schema
</h3>
<p>
This is the final schema as computed by NORMA, though from an older
version of the model that had Team entrants. It still serves to give
you a flavour of the relational mapping process.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/OrienteeringER.png"></p>

<br clear="all">

<h3>
Relational Schema expressed in pseudo-ORM form
</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Orienteering/OrienteeringER.png"></p>

This diagram was produced in NORMA, but it is not elementary, rather it's a
representation of just the administration part of the relational schema. I've
turned off the red ink that NORMA displays when it detects non-elementary
schemas. When the ActiveFacts project extracts the schema from a relational
database, or one that's been absorbed into compound (relational) form,
this is how it might look in ORM notation.
