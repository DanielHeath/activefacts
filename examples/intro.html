  <p> Congratulations, you're just a few minutes away from knowing a more
  agile way to design good database schemas.  These models were created in ORM2
  using <a href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/">NORMA</a>.
  ORM2 terminology is <em>emphasised</em> on first use. Although the CQL here
  was generated from the ORM2, you can produce the same effect by writing it
  yourself.
  </p>

  <a name="CompanyDirectorEmployee"></a>
  <h3>CompanyDirectorEmployee</h3>
  <p>This model shows the some of the relationships of a person to a company of
  which they are a director or employee.
  </p>

  <table class="examples" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td style='width:25%; border:0;'>View the generated:</td>
  <td><a href="CQL/CompanyDirectorEmployee.cql">CQL</a></td>

  <td><a href="SQL/CompanyDirectorEmployee.sql">SQL</a></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p><center>

  </center>
  </p>

  <p>This model includes examples of the features of ORM2 you'll be seeing most often.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Entity Types</i> (<b>Person</b>, <b>Company</b>) and <i>Value Types</i>
      (Name, Date). Collectively, ActiveFacts calls them Concepts. Value types
      have a dashed outline.
    </li>

    <li>Entity <i>Identification schemes</i>: Person is identified by the pair
      of values (given-Name, family-Name), as indicated by the circle with two
      lines across it. Company is identified by a single CompanyName, but since
      this is a common pattern, it's included within the Company shape, which
      is called a <b>reference mode</b>. Every Entity Type must have some
      identification scheme or preferred identifier, which enables us to tell
      the instances apart.
      </li>

    <li><i>Subtype:</i> <b>Employee</b> and <b>Manager</b> are subtypes.
      Employee has a dashed arrow, because it has its own identification scheme,
      it doesn't use Persons's scheme. An EntityType may have multiple supertypes,
      and an instance may play any role of its supertypes (so we can record the
      Birth-Date of an Employee, for example).
      </li>

    <li><i>Fact Types</i> define relationships between concepts. They're displayed
      as a series of one or more <i>Role</i> boxes. For example, the fact type
      "Person has given-Name" has two roles, played by Person and Name.
      The <b>unary fact type</b> <i>Meeting is board meeting</i> indicates a
      true/false condition with respect to a meeting.
      </li>

    <li><i>Objectified Fact Type:</i> <b>Directorship</b> and <b>Meeting</b> are
      fact types that are also entities, and thus can play other roles, such as
      the role of Directorship in "Directorship began on appointment-Date".
      </li>

    <li><i>Fact Readings</i> are displayed as text under each fact type. A fact
      type may have many readings, though only the preferred one is shown on the
      diagram. Binary fact types may display a reading for each direction. An
      arrow is displayed if a single reading is to be read in the opposite order
      from the obvious one.
      </li>

    <li><i>Uniqueness constraints</i>: The horizontal lines above the fact types
      are uniqueness constraints (UC). A UC covering a single role allows that
      role's player to occur only once all the instances of that fact type (what
      we call the <b>population</b> of that fact type). A UC that covers two or
      more roles allows any combination of those players, but only once for each
      combination. An </b>external</b> UC may connect to roles in more than one
      fact type, and is shown as a circle with a line across it. If any of the
      UC lines is doubles, that UC acts as a preferred identifier for the indicated
      entity type.
      </li>

    <li><i>Mandatory constraint</i>: The heavy dot on some role connectors (like
      the one on the Company role box of Director) is a mandatory constraint that
      requires every company to have at least one director. A mandatory constraint
      may also be shown as a hollow dot, which says <i>should</i>, rather than
      <i>must</i>.
      </li>

    <li><i>External Mandatory constraint</i>: The circle containing a crossed dot
      which is joined to "is ceo" and "Employee is supervised by Manager" is a
      mandatory exclusion constraint. The cross (X) indicates exclusion (only one)
      and the dot indicates mandatory (at least one). Both types may also occur
      separately.
      </li>

    <li><i>Ring constraint</i>: A Ring constraint is attached to the "Employee is
      supervised by Manager". This one is acyclic, indicating that an Employee
      may not supervise themselves, or anyone who supervises them, and so on.
      There are a number of other types of ring constraints.
      </li>

    <li><i>Role Value Restriction</i>: The Date value recorded for a person's birth
      date may not be before the year 1900. Other Date values don't have this
      same restriction.
      </li>

  </ul>

  <a name="SchoolActivities">
  </a>
  <h3>SchoolActivities
  </h3>
  <p>This model represents students representing their school in school-sanctioned activities.
  </p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/SchoolActivities.png"></p>

  <p>
  The model has three interesting constraints:
  <dl>
    <dt> Uniqueness over <em>Student represents School in Activity</em>:</dt>
    <dd> Allows a given Student may only participate in a given Activity for a single School</dd>
    <dt> <b>Subset</b> from Participation to Enrollment</dt>
    <dd> Only for the School in which they're enrolled</dd>
    <dt> <b>Subset</b> from Participation to Sanctions</dt>
    <dd> Only if the School sanctions that activity.</dd>
  </p>

  <p> The rules of <em>elementarity</em> require that every fact type having N roles has
  a uniqueness constraint over either N or N-1 roles, and never over fewer roles.
  This is satisfied here by the StudentParticipation having a uniqueness constraint
  over two of its three roles.
  </p>

  <p>
  The subset constraints work like this. The student is enrolled in exactly one school,
  and the set of (School, Student) pairs is a superset of the (School, Student) pair
  inside the StudentParticipation ternary. In simple terms, this requires that each
  student who participates in some activity may only do so as a representative of the
  school in which they're enrolled, and not for any other school. The other subset
  constraint requires that such participation may only occur for an activity that is
  sanctioned by that school. The direction of the subset arrow is consistent with the
  arrows used in sub-typing, as shown in the next case.
  </p>

  <a name="Death"></a>
  <h3>Death</h3>
  <img src="images/Death.png" align="right">
  This example is more a curiosity than anything else, serving to illustrate a case
  that you might not otherwise think was possible. Person may play a unary role in
  the fact type &quot;is dead&quot;. If they are in fact dead, we might wish to
  record some facts about the event of their death, so we nest (objectify) the
  &quot;is dead&quot; fact type as a new entity, Death. This allows us to
  associate their death with a value indicating the cause of death. The uniqueness
  constraint requires that we record only one cause of death.
  <p>

  <br clear="all">
  <a name="Address">
  </a>
  <h3>
  Address
  </h3>

  <p>The Address model shows how a mass of fine semantic detail can be turned into
  an efficient relational database structure, through the miracle of <em>absorption</em>.
  </p>

  <table class="examples" width="100%">
  <tr>
  <td style='width:25%; border:0;'>View the generated:</td>
  <td><a href="CQL/Address.cql">CQL</a></td>
  <td><a href="ruby/Address.rb">Ruby</a></td>
  <td><a href="SQL/Address.sql">SQL</a></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/Address.png" class="hangleft">

  <p>Note that the preferred identifier for Street covers all its functional roles.
  Essentially that means that whereever we have a Street, all the attributes of that
  street must be provided; so we can include them in more than one table without
  breaking the relational <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">Third
  Normal Form</a>, which would introduce unsafe duplication.

  </p><p>
  The same thing pertains for Address, so we can have an Address in both the Company
  and Person tables without breaking normalisation. Here's the generated SQL created
  by <em>afgen</em>:

  </p> <p>
  <img src="images/Address.SQL.png" align="left">
  </p>
  <br clear="all">

  <p>Note also that the SQL doesn't enforce the uniqueness constraint requiring
  that each Address occurs once only. There's no need to. Each Address is
  identified by its roles, but more than one person may live at the same address,
  and a company might have its HQ there too. If you want all the distinct addresses,
  you can write an SQL UNION query for that.
  </p>

  <p>If you want an Address table anyhow, you can mark it as <em>independent</em>,
  which is an instruction to the absorption process that an instance of this entity
  type might exist apart from any other roles it might play. Independent entity types
  are shown in ORM2 as having an exclamation point <b>!</b> after their name. In
  order to represent an independent entity type in SQL, a separate table is always
  needed.
  </p>

  <p> If you were to add a functional role to Address that's not part of its
  identifier, the rules of normalisation gazump absorption and Address will become
  an independent table. In that case, Company and Person would have each a large
  multi-part foreign key into the new Address table, so it might be preferable to
  introduce a <i>surrogate key</i> in the form of a database-allocated unique integer
  into the address entity, and mark that key as the preferred identifier instead.
  This can be done with <em>minimal</em> change to the semantic model, so any queries
  you have will probably still <b>just work</b> - this is a key advantage of the
  semantic approach.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note that the absorption process must know <b>all</b> the entity types, fact types,
  and constraints for the model. If you add a single fact type or change a constraint,
  that might require that some concepts are represented in new tables, or different ones,
  and these changes can <b>cascade</b>, so that a small change in the conceptual model
  requires a large database migration. If you've written your program using the
  Constellation API, you'll have <em>minimal rework</em>.

  Orienteering
  </h3>
  <p>Here's a three-part model of a system for the sport of Orienteering.  The
  three parts cover administration, registration and scoring respectively, which
  also happens to map areas of interest to folk in different roles.  Any feature
  may show on more than one diagram, and the ORM2 rules don't indicate that such
  an element has a special affinity with any diagram on which it appears.
  Concepts that appear in more than one place are shown with a drop-shadow. The
  diagrams are presented without much comment, and after that, the absorbed
  (compound) form is shown as an entity-relationship diagram.  </p>

  <a name="Administration"></a>
  <h3>
  Administration
  </h3>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/Orienteering/Administration.png">
  </p>

  <p>
  A couple of new features are shown here. <i>Number</i> has a <b>Value restriction</b>,
  which is similar to the role value restrictions we saw before, except it applies
  to all <i>Number</i>s.
  </p>

  <p>Also here you'll see an external mandatory constraint without an exclusive
  cross.  This one requires that an event is either part of a series, or has a name,
  or <b>both</b>. If and only if the event is part of a series, it must also have a
  number in that series - this is shown by the <b>equality constraint</b>, a
  circle with an = sign in it.  </p>

  </p>

  <p>This model also shows the resultant score for a given Entrant's
  Entry to a given Event. This value will be computed from the times
  of their visits to punches during the event, according to a scoring
  method as advised. The asterisks indicate that the role value is
  derived from other values in the model, or that some values may
  be derived and others now.
