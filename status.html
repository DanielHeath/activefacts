    ActiveFacts Project Status
  </h2>

  <p>
  The Constellation Query Language has almost-complete DDL support,
  sufficient to allow conversion of any ORM2 model. The Ruby generator is
  complete, and the SQL generator is complete also, though it has a couple
  of known defects. The generated Ruby code has only a partial
  implementation of the mapping data needed to convert to and from SQL
  tables, and even that has to be enabled using an option.
  </p>

  <p>
  CQL is not yet handling imported vocabularies, example fact populations or
  value type units yet. It has limited model validation facilities, and it's
  not yet possible to add a new reading to an existing fact type.  It's also
  only parsing query syntax, with no semantic analysis or SQL generation.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Constellation API (in Ruby) supports the generated Ruby code, allowing
  any fact population to be constructed for a given vocabulary.  There is
  not yet any support within the API for database persistence, but that's
  coming up for implementation soon.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Metamodel is generated to Ruby from CQL or ORM2 to support the
  creation and manipulation of any semantic model. Some changes are upcoming
  to support a vocabulary that provides a translation of an existing
  vocabulary, such as a Dutch or Japanese version of an English language
  model.
  </p>

  <p>
  ActiveFacts can currently read models from NORMA, which are in elementary
  form, and it can reverse engineer the schemas of existing databases in SQL
  Server, DB2, Oracle, and open-source databases not yet tested including
  MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.  Reverse-engineered models are still in composite
  form - the mapping to elementary form is incomplete.  Reverse engineering
  does not yet analyse actual data.
  </p>

  <p>
  ActiveFacts has no database adapter infrastructure yet. The
  previously-available reverse engineering tools used used the
  infrastructure of ActiveRecord with DRYSql and Composite Primary Keys, but
  future versions will probably just use the ActiveRecord adapters directly.
  </p>

  <!--p>
  APRIMO allows the definition of vocabulary aspects as well as the addition
  of entity and value objects and the fact types that link them.  Subtyping,
  data types and units, and complex constraints are still to be implemented.
