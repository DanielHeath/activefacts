External Constraints are of various types, and use fact readings with
role players that may occur in more than one reading. Adjectives, role
names and subscripts may be used to disambiguate multiple occurrences
of the same term.

	// A subset constraint:
	Person is an Employee
		only if Person has Tax File Number;

	// Mandatory constraint:
	each Person occurs at least one time in
		Person has mobile Phone Nr,
		Person has mailing Address;
	// Alternate syntax:
	either Person has mobile Phone Nr or Phone has mailing Address;

	// Uniqueness constraint:
	each combination Series, Number occurs at most one time in
		Event is in Series,
		Event has Number;

	// Disjunctive mandatory constraint:
	each Person occurs one time in
		Person is employeed by Company,
		Person receives Unemployment Benefits;
		Person is unsupported,
	// Alternate syntax
	either Employee reports to Manager or Employee runs Company but not both;

	// Equality constraint with joins:
	Ticket is for Seat that is at Venue
		if and only if
		Ticket is for Event that is held at Venue;
}
	when /entity/
	  puts %q{
Entity Type with simple identification (a one-to-one with a value type):

	Employee is identified by its Nr; // Asserts the value type 'Employee Nr'

The Value Type 'Employee Nr' is created if necessary, and the supertype 'Nr'
also.  You may add alternate readings (to "...has..." and "...is for...")
in a where clause.

Entity Type with a compound identifier:

	Person is identified by given Name and family Name where
		Person is called given-Name,
		Person has family-Name;

An Entity Type may be a subtype of one or more other Entity Types.
If no identification is declared for a subtype, it uses the identification
of its first supertype:

Vehicle Policy is a kind of Insurance Policy;
}
	when /fact/
	  puts %Q{
A Fact Type consists of one or more readings, where every reading has
the same role players interspersed amongst unrestricted (almost!) text.
Each role player is a Term (/help term) which denotes a Value Type or
Entity Type (including an objectified Fact Type). Terms are always
singular (except where a singular group is indicated).

The last role player in each reading may be preceded by a quantifier
(one, at most one, at least one, etc). Note that "one" or "at least one"
make the relevant fact instance mandatory:

	Person directs Company,
		Company is directed by at least 2 Person;

Any role player may be preceeded or followed by an adjective, using
an adjacent hyphen to indicate the adjective. The hyphen is required
only for one occurrence of the adjective, and other occurrences will
be recognised.  Other hyphenated words are allowed in readings, as
long as neither word is an existing term.

	// Using the Entity Type 'Person' and Value Type 'Name':
	Person has one family Name, family-Name is of Person;

	// Using the Entity Type 'Personne' and Value Type 'Nom':
	Personne à Nom-donné;

Multiple adjectives may be used, as long as the hyphen has adjacent space:

	Person driving semi-trailer avoided stray- farm Animal;

Any role player may define a Role Name, which is used to refer to
this player in other readings of this fact type:

	Person (as Director) directs Company,
		Company is directed by Director;

Any role player may be followed by a role value restriction (/help constraint):

	Person was born on one birth-Date restricted to {'1900/01/01'..};

A Fact Type which has no embedded uniqueness constraint must be
objectified (named) by prefixing it with an "is where" clause.
An objectified fact type is an Entity Type, so maye be used as a
player in subsequent Fact Types:

	Directorship is where
		Person directs Company;
	Directorship began on at most one appointment-Date;

Finally, an objectified Fact Type may be a subtype, and may also have
separate identification like an Entity Type (/help entity):

	Vehicle Claim is a kind of Insurance Claim identified by Incident ID where
		Incident ID is of one Vehicle Claim,
		Vehicle Claim has one Incident ID,
		Insured Person claimed against Policy on Date;
}
	when /instance/
	  puts %Q{
An instance (or a collection of instances) is a reading or term (or
joined collection of readings) with values following the Value Types.
Simply-identified entities may be contracted by providing the value directly.
Adjectives, role names and subscripts may be used to differentiate multiple
occurrences of the same object types.

	Company Name 'Microsoft';   // An instance of Company Name (a Value Type)
	Company 'Sun';		    // An instance of Company identified by the Company Name 'Sun'
	Company 'Sun' was founded on Date '1982-02-24';	// A simple binary fact over two objects
	family Name 'Smith' is of Person, Person has given Name 'Daniel'; // Two facts joined
	family Name 'Smith' is of Person who has given Name 'Daniel'; // The same, contracted
	// A collection of facts involving several kinds of join:
	Directorship (where Person directs Company 'Sun') began in Year '1982',
		family Name 'Joy' is of Person that has given Name 'Bill',
		Person was born on Date '1954-11-8;
}
	when /query/
	  puts %Q{
Queries are not yet implemented
}
	when /term/
	  puts %Q{
A Term is used to identify a Value Type or Entity Type (collectively, Object
Types). A Term may be any word or sequence of words, each word being one
or more alphanumeric characters (or underscore) but not starting with a
digit. Terms are preferably capitalised; this makes it easier to construct
unambiguous fact type readings.

Many keywords are disallowed as Terms, but not all.
}
	when /value/
	  puts %Q{
A Value Type is a kind of Object Type which has an accepted written form.
For example, a Name or a Date can be written, but a Person cannot. A Year
is not a Value Type, but a Year Number is.

Every written value must uniquely identify one instance of that Value Type.
A value may have more than one written form. For example, the number 10000
may also be written 10E4. A written value may identify a single instance of
more than one value type however; the string '9/11' may identify a fraction,
or an event.

Value Types are asserted by the phrase "is written as":

	Birth Date is written as Date;
	Employee Nr is written as Integer;

If the supertype (the value type after "is written as") is unknown, it is
also asserted as a Value Type.

A Value Type may have implicit length and scale properties, and in future,
may also have custom properties. Property values are defined in parentheses
after the supertype:

	Money Amount is written as Decimal(14, 2);
	Company Name is written as String(60);

After any parameter list, a Value Type may be associated with a Unit, and be
subject to a Value Restriction (using "restricted to { <values or ranges> }").
Either the low end or the high end of a range may be omitted for an open range.

	Drill Size is written as Real in mm restricted to { 0.3, 0.5..15.0};
}
