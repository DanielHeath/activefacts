    <p>
    ActiveFacts is a <strong>semantic modeling toolkit</strong> that
    revolutionises the processes of software <strong>specification</strong>,
    <strong>design</strong>, and <strong>implementation</strong>. It
    incorporates the Constellation Query Language (CQL) and the Constellation
    API, which together enable your data to be designed, expressed and
    queried in a completely natural form for the first time. The language
    is so easy to learn and use because of the way it incorporates natural
    language expressions into a formal framework. This allows the business
    user (in conjunction with the programmer and database experts) to use
    the language to express the rules and behaviour of the business domain,
    in the process formulating efficient database designs without needing
    specialist database skills.

    <h3> Constellation Query Language </h3>

      <p> CQL achieves the seemingly impossible task of combining the
	  precision of a <strong>formal</strong> language with the
	  intuitive feel of natural language. It can be used both to
	  define and query semantic models. You can write CQL models
	  directly, use APRIMO, or import <a href="examples/intro.html"
	  >ORM2</a> models from <a
	  href="http://www.ormfoundation.org/files/">NORMA</a>.  See
	  some <a href="examples/">example</a> models, or read the <a
	  href="CQLIntroduction.html">specification</a>.
      </p>

    <h3> Constellation API </h3>
      <p> The Constellation API goes beyond object-oriented to
	  fact-oriented programming, introducing a new way to code
	  transactional applications.  A Constellation of related facts
	  derived from a query can be modified only by <em>assert</em>
	  and <em>retract</em> operations.  The result is translated
	  back to relational form and saved on demand.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the preferred case, each user action results in a
	  single query, which can span deeply into and across the
	  whole database (more than just a relational join),
	  returning only the data required to respond to that action.
	  Any required changes are made to the result Constellation,
	  and a single <em>save</em> operation pushes all the changes
	  resulting from the user's action back into the database in
	  a single atomic action.
	</p>

    <h3> Code generators </h3>
      <p> The ActiveFacts code generation framework reads CQL
	  and emits extensible and effective object models for
	  use with the Constellation API, and efficient SQL
	  for whatever relational database product you're using.
	  Learn to write CQL and have a play with the open source
	  <a href="download.html">Ruby code generator</a>.
      </p>

    <h3> APRIMO </h3>
      <p> APRIMO is a semantic model development environment,
	  incorporating a Flash-based graphical designer that
	  implements ORM2 diagrams, with direct CQL entry and
	  even reverse engineering tools for existing databases.
	  APRIMO is not yet publicly available.
