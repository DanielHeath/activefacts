# These files are concerned with calculating a relational schema for a vocabulary:
require 'activefacts/persistence/reference'
require 'activefacts/persistence/tables'
require 'activefacts/persistence/columns'
require 'activefacts/persistence/foreignkey'
require 'activefacts/persistence/index'

# These extend the API classes with relational awareness:
require 'activefacts/persistence/object_type'
