Metamodel topics on which a position needs to be finalised:

1) Is my model for Units sufficient for now, even though it can't convert
   temperatures between systems?

2) My model lacks a way to use join paths, so there's no way to express
   constraints over joins. Needed yet? Simple to add?

3) Is the model for Imports, Correspondence and Aliases rich enough yet?
