Metamodel topics on which a position needs to be finalised:

1) RoleNames not being allowed to conflict with ObjectType names
   (Important for parsing CQL... I only use them as a shorthand for a
   subtype).

2) ValueType vs DataType - do we need both? I think not. I'm going to
   leave DataTypes absent from my model for now, though NORMA has them
   in.

3) Should we model ValueType/DataType parameters (what the NORMA team
   calls facets)? It's not hard, but it's not hard to add later either,
   and the current picture shows what both tools are actually doing.

4) Is my model for Units sufficient for now, even though it can't convert
   temperatures between systems?

5) My model lacks a way to use join paths, so there's no way to express
   constraints over joins. Needed yet? Simple to add?

6) Is the model for Imports, Correspondence and Aliases rich enough yet?
